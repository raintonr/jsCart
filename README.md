jsCart
======

Just a fiddle about with node to make a basic shopping cart.

Later exented to include QoS templates. That is, templates processed server side, but exported to client for later processing if the model a template requires is not available within the given timeframe.


How to run it
=============

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Then hit one of these URLS:

http://localhost:3030/qosTemplates.html

http://localhost:3030/cart.html
